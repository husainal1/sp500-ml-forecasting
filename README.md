S&P 500 Stock Prediction Project
This project explores building a machine learning model to predict the direction of the S&P 500 stock market. It uses historical S&P 500 data obtained via the yfinance library and employs a RandomForestClassifier for prediction.

Project Status
Currently, the project focuses on:

-Fetching historical S&P 500 data.
-Basic data cleaning and preparation.
-Creating technical indicators as predictors (rolling averages and trends).
-Training a RandomForestClassifier model.
-Backtesting the model's performance on historical data.
-Incorporating external economic factors (CPI and Federal Funds Rate) as additional predictors.

Note: The current model shows a precision socre of 0.5717566016073479, indicating the need for further improvement.
